        <p class="love_tech">Technology is very fun because you always learn something new and can always experiment this newly acquired knowledge on phones or 
            laptops to get a more insightful knowledge on it and this is one of the reasons why<b> I love Technology.</b> Tech makes peoples jobs 
            easier and more productive.</p>
            <p class="love_tech">Technology also opens up educational opportunities to people. It helps to stay connected with family and friends as 
            well, as it serves as a means of communication. Almost everything is connected together through Technology
            from the music, to the movies, calls, online classes etc, <i>everything is all connected.</i> </p>

        <p class="learnt">I started this journey with Stutern a month ago when I applied to learn software testing and it's safe to say that
            from having no knowledge on anything coding related, I can now do basic things. I have learnt web designs to a certain 
            stage and I am so excited. I can write an HTML skeleton of whatever I'm trying to create or recreate and I know how to use most
            elements and make sense of them. I can also design that skeleton with CSS for beautification. I learn a new thing 
            everyday and <i> I'm super excited to see my progress because its been a tough ride of which I would overcome.</i>
        </p>

        <p class="learnt">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is an important design language that makes a webpage look more appealing because it adds beauty
            to your HTML. HTML is a markup language ans <b>CSS is a stylesheet language</b> that is usually connected to the HTML page with 
            a link tag within the head tag. It gives some sort of eye satisfaction to your already prepared HTML skeleton. 
            You can be as creative as you want with CSS as there is no particular way things should be done but rather done to showcase
            your creativity to your taste and satisfaction. CSS is like the front-end aspect, what you see and not what goes on in the back.
            There are a lot of CSS properties that you explore and be creative with.</p>

        <p class="bmp">Borders, Margins and Paddings are all CSS features and they are used in the adding beauty to your HTML Skeleton. <i>They are now discussed in seriatim:</i>
            Borders allow you to specify how you want the borders of a box representing an element to look. You can specify how you
            want the borders to look if its solid, dashed, dotted etc. to look by using border style. you can change border colors, give
            the border a size and add other properties to the borders, the insides and outsides of the borders as well.  
            </p>

        <p class="bmp">Also, margins and paddings are used to give space and may be confusing, they are entirely different.
            Margins are used to give spacing to the area outside the box. Spacing out the box from it's surroundings.
            It can be likened a notebook, where you rule margins, the space you rule out is the margin and the contents are in the box. 
            Padding on the other hand is to give space to the contents within the box itself, spacing the borders away from the text(s). 
            You can give values to the tob, buttom, left and right of margins and paddings.
            <b>In conclusion, paddings are spaces within the borders and margins are the spaces given outside the borders.</b></p>
